    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked elbow macaronie</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt, undivided</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 can (12 ounce) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter cut into pieces</li>
        <li>3 ounces cream cheese, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>16 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat; add macaroni and 4 1/2 teaspoons salt. Cook pasta until just barely tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
        <li>Spray the inside of a slow cooker with cooking spray. Add pasta to the slow cooker and stir in milk, evaporated milk, butter, cream cheese and pepper.</li>
        <li>Whisk together egg and egg yolk in a small bowl until well combined; stir into pasta mixture. Set aside 3/4 cup shredded cheese.</li>
        <li>Stir remaining cheese into pasta mixture, cover, and cook on Low until bubbly and lightly browned around the edges, about 1 1/2 hours.        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle with reserved cheese, cover, and cook until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes more. Serve immediately. Alternatively, turn crockpot to Warm or Off until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
